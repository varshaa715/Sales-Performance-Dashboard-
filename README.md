# Sales-Performance-Dashboard-
Project Description / Purpose
This is an interactive analytics dashboard designed to track and analyze open-source repository contributions over time. It provides a clear visual overview of contribution patterns, top contributors, and repository health metrics. The goal is to help users easily interpret trends, identify high-performing contributors, and monitor project activity for better decision-making.

Tech Stack
Power BI – for creating interactive visualizations and dashboard design
Excel / CSV – for cleaning and structuring data before visualization
Kaggle Dataset – as the primary data source

Data Source
Dataset imported from Kaggle, containing repository activity data such as commits, pull requests, issues, and contributor details
Data cleaned and pre-processed in Excel before integrating into Power BI

Features & Highlights
📊 Trends of commits and contributions over time
👥 Ranking of top contributors by activity level
🗂 Repository-level metrics including issues and updates
⏳ Time-based breakdown (weekly, monthly, yearly)
🔍 Interactive filters to drill down into specific periods or contributors

Business Problem
In large open-source projects, tracking contribution activity manually is inefficient and prone to oversight. Without a consolidated view, project managers and community maintainers may miss trends that impact engagement, productivity, and issue resolution speed.
